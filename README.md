About
==
In this project, I designed and built a bionic hand controlled by user input. I undertook this challenge to enhance my skills in CAD design, programming, and electronics. While only using my laptop, 3D printer, and Arduino, I was able to bring this idea to life. The primary goals were to achieve realistic hand motion and enable both independent and simultaneous control of individual fingers, while staying within a low budget.

Design
==
The design I created consists of compliant fingers, motors built into the palm, a capacitive touch interface, and a stand to conceal all of the cables. To add compliance in the fingers, I created the joints out of TPU and the rest of the project in PLA. When force was applied, the fingers were able to bend and then return to their original position. This design allowed for the strength of a rigid finger, but the movement of a flexible one.
