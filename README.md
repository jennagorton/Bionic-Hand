About
==
In this project, I designed and built a bionic hand controlled by user input. I undertook this challenge to enhance my skills in CAD design, programming, and electronics. While only using my laptop, 3D printer, and Arduino, I was able to bring this idea to life. The primary goals were to achieve realistic hand motion and enable both independent and simultaneous control of individual fingers, while staying within a low budget.

Design
==
The design incorporates compliant fingers, palm-integrated motors, a capacitive touch interface, and a cable-concealing stand.
- To introduce compliance in the fingers, I fabricated the joints using TPU, while the rest of the structure was printed in PLA. This material combination allowed the fingers to bend under applied force and return to their original position, providing the strength of a rigid finger with the flexibility of a compliant one.
- By integrating the servos within the palm, the hand functions independently without requiring an attached arm. This compact, self-contained design ensures compatibility with various arm attachmentsâ€”whether used as a prosthetic or as a component of a larger robotic system.

Programming
=
This is an Arduino-based project and implemented built-in libraries
- Can handle single finger movement and simultaneoulsy whole hand configurations.
